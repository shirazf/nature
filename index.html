      <font face="verdana" color="#161616"><p> The year is 2095, and a UFO crashes into a chicken coop in the last remaining animal farm in New York. The crash kills all the chickens and is so loud that it causes the cows to scatter and run away. While running from the UFO, one cow trips over a rock and falls. Another cow trips over that cow, and then another, and another. This causes a large pile-up of cows in the middle of the farm. The cows and chickens are now all either dead, injured, or lost, so their eggs and milk cannot be collected. Since these animal products cannot be collected, the farm goes out of business. This causes there to be a shortage of dairy and eggs throughout New York. The shortage of dairy and eggs causes all of New York to turn to veganism. Once they turn to veganism, the people eat more vegetables. They eat so many vegetables that all the farms in New York run out of vegetables. This causes the vegans to eat mostly grain products imported from other communities. This diet causes New Yorkers to have weak bones and muscles, so they cannot fight against the growing population of aliens. By failing to fight against the aliens, the aliens overcome the humans and take over all of New York. </p</font>
